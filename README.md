 <h1> First Group Project </h1>
 
 <h2> Trashie </h2> 
 
 <p> This was the first major project I completed with GW Coding Bootcamp.  It uses geolocation and firebase to help people track the location of trash/trash spills and areas that need clean-up.  It also has a heatmap, a user-login and a user can track where they have saved trash locations.  </p>
